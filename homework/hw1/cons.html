            <ul class="list">
              <li>Often need a computer.<br>
                  <p>Many schools cannot find the funding to buy every student a computer for them to learn code. Schools
                  are already struggling as it is. </p>
              </li>
              <li>Teaching is already difficult for teachers.<br>
                  <p>Teachers often don't have the time to learn another subject. Teachers are stressed with the workload that they 
                  already need to give out. Adding more material will end up doing more bad than good.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Young students need to have fun.<br>
                  <p>Teaching a young student how to code is already difficult enough. Being a young student is about having fun
                  and enjoying their early years of school. </p>
              </li>
              <li>Teachers are not teaching code correctly.<br>
                  <p>There are teachers that are teaching students how to code now. Often teachers don't know the material themselves. 
                  How can teachers teach something they are not comfortbale with? Students will suffer because of this.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Difficult for students.<br>
                  <p>The concepts of coding may be too difficult for students. This may keep students away when they mature. The ages
                  that students need to learn how to code are 13-16.</p>
