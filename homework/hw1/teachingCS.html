            <p class="info"><b><u>Overview</u>:</b> Math, English, History, and Science are all subjects that are taught in early education.
            What if we introduced a new subject into the mix? The subject that needs to be introduced is coding. Coding, also known as programming, 
            is the process of assigning a code to something for the purposes of classification or identification. Young students will have 
            the opportunity to learn something new! Obtaining these skills at an early age may benefit them for future careers. 
            Not all people are on board with adding coding to the curriculum. Many argue that schools shouldn't force students to learn a subject 
            that is so complex. Others bring up the point that young students should enjoy their early years in the education system exploring 
            different topics on different areas.</br>
            Throughout this site I will be discussing the pros and cons of teaching coding/programming to young students. The goal is to learn 
            about both sides of the topic and even if you do not agree with one side you will have a better understanding of where the opposite side is
            coming from.
