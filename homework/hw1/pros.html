              <li>Teaches students valuable new skills <br>
                  <p>Logical thinking, Problem solving, Persistence, Collaboration, and Communication are all skills
                  that being taught with coding. Even if students do not continue to learn code when they mature, they will 
                  always have those valuable skills for a future career.</p>
              </li>
              <li>A career for the future.</li>

              <li>Empowers students.</li>
                  <p>Students get to express themselves through code. Learning how to control computers and making them solve
                  complex problems. Some may say its like having a superpower. </p>
              <li>Easy as learning a new language.</li>
                  <p>Many would have you believe that you need to be a rocket scienctist in order to learn how to code, but
                  that is simply not true. Students can learn how to code in days. Especially with the programs out there that are 
                  making it easier for students to learn.</p>
              <li>Becoming fluent with technology.</li>
