### Overview:
BlockBuster 2.0 was a team collaboration between 4 group members. The site was created to imitate a movie rental website. The site allows a user to choose a movie that is listed in our database. Once a user chooses a movie, information is sent to a movie API to get a picture and a bio on the movie that the user chose. During the creation of the application I learned how to use the following technologies:

+ phpMyAdmin
+ Cloud 9
+ Heroku
+ GitHub
+ HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript

### Functionality:

+ First page you will see when you enter the site.The layout uses bootstraps in order to give the site a modern looking navigation bar. 

+ Clicking on the "Preview" button on an corresponding row of a movie will reveal an info window about the movie the users has chosen to click on. 

+ On the navigation bar there is a button titled as "Popular" that will show the top 10 popular movies on our site.

+ Clicking on the “Checkout” button on the navigation bar will bring you to the “Shopping Cart” window that will show you the movie that you have chosen to rent. 

+ A random feature was also added to our site, which is located on the navigation bar. This feature would be beneficial for people who are not sure about what movie they would like to choose. 

+ We have created a drop down menu titled “More” that lets a user display movies by length, year they came out, and alphabetical order. 

+ The final feature on our navigation bar is our search feature. If you are looking for a specific movie or genre, you may use the search function to help you find the exact movie your are looking for.
