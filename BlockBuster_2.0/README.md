### Overview:
BlockBuster 2.0 was a team collobartation between 4 group members. The site was created to imitate a movie rental website. The site allows a user to choose a movie that is listed in our database. Once a user chooses a movie, information is sent to a movie API to get a picture and a bio on the movie that the user chose. During the creation of the application I learned how to use the following technologies:

+ phpMyAdmin
+ Cloud 9
+ Heroku
+ GitHub
+ HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript
