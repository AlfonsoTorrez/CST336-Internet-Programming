### Overview:
The SlothPage is a website that I created to practice using JavaScript. The site lets a user click on two buttons that display different information. One button shows pictures of sloths and the other displays sloth facts. The reason why I dicated the site on sloths is because I wanted to learn more about my favorite animal.
