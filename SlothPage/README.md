# SlothPage

### Overview:
The SlothPage is a website that I created to practice using JavaScript. The site lets a user click on two buttons that display different information. One button shows pictures of sloths and the other displays sloth facts. The reason why I dicated the site on sloths is because I wanted to learn more about my favorite animal.

+ Homepage of the SlothPage displays a clean navigation bar that is brought to you by  using Bootstraps. Inside the navigation bar is the two buttons which both display separate information. The bar also contains a text field that gives users an option to enter a number that will display the amount of sloth images, depending on the number the user enters.
